# Remote Office Sync Configuration Template
# Copy this file to config.yaml and customize for your environment
# config.yaml is gitignored and should not be committed

# Paths to sync
# ========================================
# CRITICAL: Paths MUST use forward slashes (/) NOT backslashes (\)
# ========================================
# Backslashes in YAML cause parsing errors like "unknown escape character"
#
#   ✅ CORRECT:  left_root: "C:/folder/path"
#   ❌ WRONG:    left_root: "C:\folder\path"  ← This will FAIL!
#
# Forward slashes work perfectly in Windows - they are the REQUIRED format for YAML
#
# WARNING: THIS WILL CAUSE A FILE SYNC BETWEEN THE 2 FOLDERS - ENSURE CORRECT FOLDERS
left_root: "y:/pdrive_local/"
right_root: "z:/"

# Dry run mode (RECOMMENDED: Keep enabled until you're confident in the sync behavior)
# When true, shows detailed preview of what would change with visual diagrams, but makes NO actual changes
# When false, performs actual file synchronization

# Soft delete settings

    # Set to null or omit to soft delete ALL files regardless of size (recommended)
    # Set to a number (e.g., 20) to only soft delete files <= that size (larger files are hard deleted)
    max_size_mb: null
